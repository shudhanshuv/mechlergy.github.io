                            This breaker is designed by a flexible material which will be able to impart compression. When the vehicle passes through compressible breaker it will exert pressure in the inner system of the breaker which further consists of a tube filled with incompressible fluid i.e, water.
                            <br>
                            Vehicles moving with some velocity, deaccelerates on seeing a speed breaker, here it is flexible so it will be comfortable to cross over it, but while moving through it, it will exert pressure on the FSB, that pressure is utilized using various RPG techniques. Here the FSB filled with waste water will tend to move to the sides with high velocity proportional to the force applied by the vehicle, which is connected to channel having generator unit.  Fluid locally at the channel will achieve high velocity as cross-sectional area of the channel is smaller than that of FSB.

                            Manual fixture design is made for Friction Stir Processing (FSP) over a simple Axial Drill Machine using simple arrangements and assemblies. The fixture has capabilities to orient in axial direction with the help of arrangement of worm, worm wheel and Rake in addition it can also be rotated to all directions and can be elevated up to 20 degrees. The assembly is flexible and parts can be easily removed and reassembled with its ease of availability in the market. The movable trey consists of bolts to hold specimen to sustain shear from the FSP tool. Designing was done to sustain a load of 15000 N axially whereas, the deflection was negligible. This resulted in cheap and efficient mechanism of fixture for FSP. Design was made to hold test specimen for the friction stir processing.

                            In the current scenario electricity generation is a big task as per the growing population and the degradation of the natural resources. Humanity is shifting to renewable energy resources such as wind energy, tidal energy, solar energy, nuclear energy etc. but the problem with these are either they are less efficient or cost id more as per the unit of power of other conventional techniques, these deals with the distorted form of energy from the environment and also the cost of setup or maintenance is high.<br>
                            <b>“THIS PROJECT IS FUTURE OF POWER GENERATION”</b><br>
                            By the virtue of this technique it would be easy to produce energy in the form of electricity just by the movement of vehicles on the highways with some optimum speed with the help of the technology of “Electromagnetic induction” by Faraday (Faraday’s law).
